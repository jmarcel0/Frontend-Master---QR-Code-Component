## My process

- I started by creating a div for the card itself and giving it an approximate size to what I thought it would end up being. Then, I started adding the components such as the QR code image and the text. After that, I resized everything to the appropriate size, gave it all the proper color they should be, added the border-radius to the card and the QR code image. Finally, I added the box-shadow to the card.


### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### Useful resources

- [Stack Overflow - Vertically centering a div in body?](https://stackoverflow.com/a/40868333/17463594) - This helped me remember how to vertically center a div in the body. Hopefully I will keep this in mind for future use.
